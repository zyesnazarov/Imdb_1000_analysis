# IMDB 1000 Films Analysis
Welcome to the IMDB 1000 Films Analysis project! This project explores data from the top 1000 IMDB-rated films, focusing on various aspects of the film industry, including actors, directors, budgets, box office, and ratings. By analyzing this data, we aim to uncover patterns, correlations, and interesting insights that highlight the dynamics of the movie industry over the years, particularly from 2000 to 2022.

## Objectives of the Analysis
The primary goal of this analysis is to understand trends, relationships, and performances within the top-rated films by diving deep into key metrics. We analyze aspects such as actors' prominence, correlations between ratings, the efficiency of films, and directors' success. This analysis answers the following specific questions:

## Questions for the Analysis

### 1. Show main actors (Star1) that appeared the most between 2000-2022?

Identify the top 10 actors with the most appearances in movies during the 2000-2022 period.

### 2. What are their average metascore?

Show the top 10 actors by their appearance count during 2020-2022 and analyze their average metascore.

### 3. How are metascore and IMDB rating correlated with each other over 2020-2022?

- Present a graph showing the correlation between metascore and IMDB ratings over the 2020-2022 period. Additionally, identify which genre shows the most significant difference between the two ratings.

### 4. Show the most successful top-10 directors from the top IMDB 1000 films, highlighting their average IMDB rating and box office earnings.

Display the results in a scatter plot, providing insights into the performance of top directors in terms of both ratings and commercial success.

### 5. Show the top 10 most efficient films in terms of ROI (box office/budget) over the period 1990-2022.

Present the relationship between production budget and box office returns on a graph, highlighting the efficiency of these films.


### 6. Is there any correlation between a film's budget and its IMDB or metascore rating?

Test the correlation and present the results on a graph showing the relationship between budgets and metascore/IMDB rating for the top 10 films during 2000-2022.

### Key insights

- Higher Budget Does Not Always Correlate with Higher ROI:
"Avatar" had a relatively high ROI of around 320% with a moderate production budget of about $300M, which is one of the highest ROIs in the dataset. In contrast, "Star Wars Episode VII: The Force Awakens" had the highest budget of approximately $550M, but its ROI was significantly lower (around 180%). This indicates that higher production budgets do not necessarily result in higher profitability.
- Moderate Budget Films with High ROI:
Movies like "Incredibles 2" and "The Dark Knight" achieved an ROI of over 300% with a production budget of around $200M to $250M. These films demonstrate that a more moderate budget can yield very high returns, suggesting that a carefully managed production budget combined with strong audience demand can drive substantial profitability.
- Avengers Films Have a Consistent ROI Despite High Budgets:
Films like "Avengers: Endgame" and "Avengers: Infinity War" had production budgets of $300M to $400M, with consistent ROIs between 220% to 260%. While these budgets are among the higher range in the dataset, their returns are solid, albeit not the highest in terms of percentage. This suggests that while Avengers films do well at the box office, their ROI is more balanced due to the substantial investment required for their production.
